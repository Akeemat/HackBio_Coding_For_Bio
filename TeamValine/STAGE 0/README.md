**Task Overview**

In this task, the team organized team members’ information using data structures in R and Python.

**Step 1: Collection of data from team members**

For each team member, their names, Slack usernames, emails, hobbies, countries, disciplines, and preferred programming languages were collected and recorded as follows:

Name: "Akeemat Ayinla", "Md Asif Mahmud Aumi", "Felix Idowu"

Slack\_Username: "Keemah", "Asif", "Felix"

Email: "akeematayinla\@gmail.com", "contact.aumi\@gmail.com", "idowufelix00\@gmail.com"

Hobby: "Reading novels", "Travelling, Hiking", "Football, Music"

Country: "Nigeria", "Türkiye", "Nigeria"

Discipline: "Veterinary Medicine", "Agricultural Biotechnology", "Biochemistry and Molecular Biology"

Programming\_Language: "R", "Python", "Python"

**Step 2: Coding in R and Python**

**R**

To organize the information, a data frame was created in R following each column/element accordingly. See [R script](https://github.com/Akeemat/HackBio_Coding_For_Bio/blob/main/STAGE%200/R%20Script).

The output showed a clear and logical structure of the team members’ information.

**Python**

To organize the information,

- A list of dictionaries was created, where each dictionary represents one team member. Each dictionary contained the key-value pairs for the member's details.
- The team name and each member's details were then printed with clear separators for readability.
- Comments were added for every line of the code to make it easier to understand.
