**Overview**

In this task, I practiced the creation of custom functions in R

**Function 1: Translating DNA to protein**

To achieve this custom function, I created a vector listing codons and their corresponding amino acids.

In the function, I also employed the use of in built R functions such as "nchar", "substring", "seq", "sapply" and "paste"

**Function 2: Simulating and generating a logistic population growth curve**

This function was created by inputing the formular for logistic function. The "for loop" function was then used to create a dataset which was plotted.

**Function 3: Calculating Hamming Distance**

In creating this function, I employed the use of in built R functions such as "nchar" and "strsplit"
